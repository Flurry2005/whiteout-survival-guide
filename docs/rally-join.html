        <h2>Rally joining information</h2>
        <strong>@State #3662</strong>
        <strong>Heros matter!</strong>
        <p>Only four players from everyone who joins the rally can provide an Expedition skill buff for the rally, 
            and it is important to understand how this selection process works to know how to avoid messing it up. <br><br>

            The formula for choosing who provides the buff is as follows: <br><br>

            The game looks at who joined first, second, third and fourth, and selects first Expedition skill of the joining player's
             first Hero as the buff for the rally.
            When 5th or later player joins, the game recalculates based on the Skill Level of said heroes. Meaning if a player joined
             earlier with a Hero whose first Expedition skill is not maxed (Level 5), anyone joining after them with a Hero with higher first Expedition Skill Level
              can "overwrite them".
            The way this mechanic works is both good and bad. Good, because if someone joins with a Hero with higher skill they can provide
             better bonus, and/or can overwrite a wrong hero, if that hero has low Expedition Skill Level. <br> <br>

            Bad, because if a player joins early with wrong hero with Level 5 Expedition Skill, then no one can overwrite them and they
             basically waste one of the four buff slots for the rally. Only way to change the wrong buff is to remove the player from the rally,
              then the game recalculates based on the formula described above. <br> <br>

            So if a player does not have enough of "correct" heroes, and they want to use heroes to increase their Deployment Capacity,
             they should ideally use as first Hero one that has their first Expedition Skill of Level 1, to make it as easy as possible to be overwritten by Level
              2 or higher skill from correct heroes joining after them.</p>
